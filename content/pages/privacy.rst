The Privacy policy below is adapted from the Automattic privacy policy
available `here <https://automattic.com/privacy/>`__

Your privacy is critically important to me. I have a few fundamental
principles:

-  I don’t ask you for personal information unless I truly need it. (I
   can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or
   income level for no apparent reason.)
-  I don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply
   with the law, develop products, or protect my rights.
-  I don’t store personal information on my servers unless required for
   the on-going operation of one of my services.
-  On my website, I aim to make it as simple as possible for you to
   control what’s visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept
   private, and permanently deleted.

Below is my privacy policy which incorporates these goals:

If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data
please personally contact me via email at contact@aidanharr.is.

It is my policy to respect your privacy regarding any information I may
collect while operating my website.

Website Visitors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Like most website operators, I collect non-personally-identifying
information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make
available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring
site, and the date and time of each visitor request. My purpose in
collecting non-personally identifying information is to better
understand how visitors use my website. From time to time, I may release
non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
publishing a report on trends in the usage of my website.

I also collect potentially personally-identifying information like
Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users
leaving comments. I only discloses logged in user and commenter IP
addresses under the same circumstances that I use and discloses
personally-identifying information as described below, except that
commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to
the administrators of this website where the comment was left.

Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Certain visitors to my website choose to interact with it in ways that
require me to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and
type of information that I gather depends on the nature of the
interaction. For example, I ask visitors who sign up to provide a
username and email address. In each case, I collect such information
only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of
the visitor’s interaction with me. I do not disclose
personally-identifying information other than as described below. And
visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information,
with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain
website-related activities.

Aggregated Statistics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to this website.
For instance, I may monitor the most popular posts on this site or use
spam screened by the Akismet service to help identify spam. I may
display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, I do
not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described
below.

Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I disclose potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
information only to my employees, contractors and affiliated
organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process
it on my behalf or to provide services available at my website, and (ii)
that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees,
contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your
home country; by using my website, you consent to the transfer of such
information to them. I will not rent or sell potentially
personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.
Other than to my employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as
described above, I disclose potentially personally-identifying and
personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court
order or other governmental request, or when I believe in good faith
that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or
rights of myself, third parties or the public at large. If you are a
registered user of my website and have supplied your email address,
I may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features,
solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on
with me and my products. I primarily use various product blogs to
communicate this type of information, so I expect to keep this type of
email to a minimum. If you send me a request (for example via a support
email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), I reserve the right to
publish it in order to help clarify or respond to your request or to
help support other users. I take all measures reasonably necessary to
protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction
of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
information.

Cookies
~~~~~~~

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s
computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each
time the visitor returns. I use cookies to help identify and track
visitors, their usage of my website, and their website access
preferences. Visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their
computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using
my website, with the drawback that certain features of my website may
not function properly without the aid of cookies.

The \_\_cfduid cookie is used to override any security restrictions
based on the IP address the visitor is coming from. For example, if the
visitor is in a coffee shop where there are a bunch of infected
machines, but the visitor's machine is known trusted, then the cookie
can override the security setting. It does not correspond to any userid
in the web application, nor does the cookie store any personally
identifiable information.

Business Transfers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If my website, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in
the unlikely event that I go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user
information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired
by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and
that any acquirer of my website may continue to use your personal
information as set forth in this policy.

Comments
~~~~~~~~

Comments and other content submitted to the Akismet anti-spam service
are not saved on their servers unless they were marked as false
positives, in which case they are stored long enough to use them to
improve the service to avoid future false positives.

Privacy Policy Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Although most changes are likely to be minor, I may change the Privacy
Policy from time to time, and in my sole discretion. I encourage
visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to the Privacy
Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy
Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
