Books! It's a medium that's been around since the dawn of time. These
days many of our books are electronic (ebooks). This presents a problem,
how do we organise these? One such way is through the free open source
software `Calibre <http://calibre-ebook.com>`__. Calibre allows you to
manage your books, convert them to and from various file formats and
distribute books to your various devices.
